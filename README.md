## About

The `shell` is a command-line interface ( a program) that provides a user interface to interact with an operating system's kernel or execute commands. The `shell` acts as a bridge between the user and the operating system.
This project builds a simpler version of the `shell`. It is limited in functions.

## Objectives

- Develop a custom `simple shell` that emulates the functionality
of the original `shell`.
- Deepen your understanding of the `C-programming language` and `Shell`.
- What is a `pid` and a `ppid`?
- How to manipulate the environment of the current process
- Difference between a function and a system call
- How to create processes
- Know the three prototypes of `main`
- How the shell uses `PATH` to find programs.
- How to execute another program with the `execve` system call
- How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
- What is `EOF` / “end-of-file”?
